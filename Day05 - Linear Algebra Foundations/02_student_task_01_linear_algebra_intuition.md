- b) A data point with features: temperature = 25°C, humidity = 60%, pressure = 1013 hPa
- c) A simple 3-pixel image: pixel1 = 0.2, pixel2 = 0.8, pixel3 = 0.5

**Expected Output**: Three vector representations.

### Task 3: Scalar Multiplication (Easy)

Calculate:
- a) 3 × [2, 4]
- b) -2 × [1, -3]
- c) 0.5 × [6, 8]

### Task 4: Medium Reasoning Question

Consider vectors u = [2, 3] and v = [1, 4].

- a) Calculate u + v
- b) Calculate 2u (2 times vector u)
- c) Calculate 2u + v
- d) Is vector addition commutative? (Does u + v = v + u?) Verify with these vectors.

**Expected Output**: 
- Three calculated vectors
- Verification of commutativity

### Task 5: Application to AI (Medium)

In a neural network, an input image is represented as a vector of pixel values:
- Image A: [0.1, 0.9, 0.3, 0.7]
- Image B: [0.8, 0.2, 0.6, 0.4]

- a) What does each component of these vectors represent?
- b) Calculate the "average" image: 0.5 × (Image A + Image B)
- c) What might this average image represent in the context of image processing?

**Expected Output**: 
- Written explanation
- Calculated average vector
- Written interpretation

### Task 6: Medium Reasoning Question

A person's features are represented as: [height_cm, weight_kg, age_years].

- a) Represent a person with height=180, weight=75, age=30
- b) If we scale this vector by 0.01, what does [1.8, 0.75, 0.3] represent?
- c) Why might we scale feature vectors in machine learning? (Hint: normalization)

**Expected Output**: 
- Vector representation
- Interpretation of scaled vector
- Written explanation
