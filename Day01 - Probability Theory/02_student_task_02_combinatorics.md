# Day 1 — Student Task: Combinatorics

## Instructions

Solve the following combinatorics problems. For each problem, determine whether it's a permutation or combination, show your work, and provide the final answer. Remember:
- **Permutation** = order matters
- **Combination** = order doesn't matter

## Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Permutation (Easy)

A race has 5 runners. How many different ways can the top 3 finishers be arranged (1st, 2nd, 3rd place)?

**Expected Output**: 
- Identify if this is a permutation or combination (and why)
- Show the calculation using the formula
- Provide the final numeric answer

---

### Task 2: Basic Combination (Easy)

A student needs to choose 4 courses from a list of 8 available courses. How many different course selections are possible? (Order doesn't matter)

**Expected Output**:
- Identify if this is a permutation or combination (and why)
- Show the calculation using the formula
- Provide the final numeric answer

---

### Task 3: Medium Reasoning Question

An AI researcher wants to test different combinations of hyperparameters:
- Learning rate: 3 options (0.001, 0.01, 0.1)
- Batch size: 4 options (16, 32, 64, 128)
- Number of layers: 2 options (3, 5)

How many different hyperparameter combinations are possible? (Each combination uses one value from each category)

**Expected Output**: 
- Explain your reasoning
- Show the calculation
- Provide the final answer

---

### Task 4: Medium Reasoning Question

A machine learning team has 12 features available. They want to create models using different feature subsets:
- a) How many ways can they choose 5 features?
- b) How many ways can they choose 7 features?
- c) Which gives more combinations: choosing 5 or choosing 7? Why?

**Expected Output**: 
- Answers to parts (a) and (b) with calculations
- Written explanation for part (c)

---

### Task 5: Application to AI (Medium)

A neural network architecture search algorithm needs to evaluate different layer configurations. From 6 possible layer types, it must select exactly 3 layers to use (order matters because the sequence affects the network).

- a) How many different 3-layer sequences are possible?
- b) If the algorithm can test 100 configurations per second, how long (in seconds) would it take to test all possible sequences?

**Expected Output**: 
- Answer to part (a) with calculation
- Answer to part (b) with units (seconds, minutes, or hours as appropriate)

---

### Task 6: Medium Reasoning Question

A password system allows:
- 4 positions
- Each position can be a digit (0-9) OR a letter (a-z, 26 letters)
- Total: 36 possible characters per position

How many different passwords are possible? (This is NOT a permutation or combination in the traditional sense—think about it differently)

**Expected Output**: 
- Explain why this isn't a standard permutation/combination problem
- Show your calculation method
- Provide the final answer

---

### Task 7: Optional Python Task

Write Python functions to calculate:
- `permutation(n, r)` - returns P(n, r)
- `combination(n, r)` - returns C(n, r)

Test your functions with:
- P(5, 3)
- C(10, 4)
- P(7, 2)
- C(8, 3)

**Expected Output**: Python code with both functions and test cases showing the output.

---

## Expected Output / Answer Format

For each task, provide:
- **Type identification**: Clearly state if it's a permutation, combination, or neither
- **Calculation**: Show your work using the appropriate formula
- **Final answer**: Numeric result
- **Explanation**: Brief reasoning for medium-level questions

**Note**: No solutions are provided—work through each problem independently!
