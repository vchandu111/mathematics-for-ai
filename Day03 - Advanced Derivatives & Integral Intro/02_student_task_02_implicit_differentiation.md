### Task 4: Medium Reasoning Question

Consider the equation: x·eʸ = 10

- a) Find dy/dx using implicit differentiation
- b) Rewrite your answer in terms of x only (hint: use the original equation)
- c) Verify your answer makes sense by checking: if x increases, what happens to y?

**Expected Output**: 
- Derivative expression
- Simplified form in terms of x
- Written verification

### Task 5: Application to AI (Medium)

In a neural network, the relationship between error E and weight w might be: w² + E² = 100

- a) Find dE/dw using implicit differentiation
- b) If w = 6, what is E? (use the original equation)
- c) What is dE/dw when w = 6?
- d) What does a negative dE/dw tell us about how to adjust w to reduce error?

**Expected Output**: 
- Derivative expression
- E value when w = 6
- dE/dw value at that point
- Written explanation for part (d)

### Task 6: More Complex (Medium)

Find dy/dx for: x²y³ + x·y = 6

**Hint**: You'll need to use both product rule and chain rule.

**Expected Output**: Derivative expression with all steps shown.

### Task 7: Optional Python Task

Write a Python function that can symbolically differentiate simple implicit equations. For the equation x² + y² = r², calculate dy/dx symbolically.

**Expected Output**: Python code (you may use sympy library if available) showing the derivative calculation.
