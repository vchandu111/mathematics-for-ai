# Day 1 — Student Task: Probability Basics

## Instructions

Complete the following tasks to practice calculating basic probabilities. Show your work for each problem, including:
1. Identifying the total number of outcomes
2. Identifying the favorable outcomes
3. Calculating the probability
4. Expressing your answer in at least two formats (decimal, fraction, or percentage)

## Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Probability (Easy)

A standard six-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling:
- a) A 3?
- b) A number greater than 4?
- c) An odd number?

**Expected Output**: Provide three probability values (one for each part), expressed as both a fraction and a decimal.

### Task 2: Basic Probability (Easy)

A bag contains 5 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles (10 marbles total). If you randomly pick one marble:
- a) What is the probability of picking a red marble?
- b) What is the probability of picking a blue marble?
- c) What is the probability of picking a green marble?

**Expected Output**: Provide three probability values, expressed as fractions in simplest form and as percentages.

### Task 3: Medium Reasoning Question

An AI model is trained on 10,000 images. The dataset contains:
- 6,000 images of cats
- 3,000 images of dogs
- 1,000 images of birds

If the model randomly selects one image from this dataset, what is the probability it selects:
- a) A cat image?
- b) A dog image?
- c) A bird image?
- d) Either a cat or a dog image?

**Expected Output**: Provide four probability values with brief explanations of your reasoning.

### Task 4: Medium Reasoning Question

A weather prediction AI analyzed historical data and found that in a particular city:
- It rained on 60 out of 300 days analyzed
- It was sunny on 180 days
- It was cloudy (but no rain) on the remaining days

Calculate:
- a) The probability of rain on any given day
- b) The probability of sunshine
- c) The probability of cloudy weather (no rain)

**Expected Output**: Provide three probability values with a brief explanation of how this relates to AI weather prediction systems.

### Task 5: Application to AI (Medium)

A spam detection system analyzed 5,000 emails and classified them as:
- 1,500 spam emails
- 3,500 legitimate emails

Answer the following:
- a) What is the probability that a randomly selected email from this dataset is spam?
- b) What is the probability that a randomly selected email is legitimate?
- c) If the AI system uses a threshold of 0.3 (30%) to classify emails as spam, would a new email with a calculated spam probability of 0.25 be classified as spam or legitimate? Explain your reasoning.

**Expected Output**: Provide answers to parts (a) and (b) as probabilities, and a written explanation for part (c).

---

### Task 6: Optional Python Task

Write a simple Python function that calculates probability given the number of favorable outcomes and total outcomes. Test it with:
- Example 1: 3 favorable out of 6 total
- Example 2: 25 favorable out of 100 total
- Example 3: 7 favorable out of 20 total

**Expected Output**: Python code with function definition and three test cases showing the output (probability as a decimal).

## Expected Output / Answer Format

For each task, provide:
- **Numeric answers**: Express probabilities as fractions (simplified), decimals (to 3 decimal places), and percentages
- **Explanation in words**: Brief reasoning for medium-level questions
- **Work shown**: Clearly show how you identified favorable and total outcomes

**Note**: No solutions are provided—work through each problem independently!
