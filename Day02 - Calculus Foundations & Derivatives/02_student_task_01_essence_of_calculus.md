# Day 2 — Student Task: Essence of Calculus

## Instructions

Complete the following tasks to build intuition about calculus concepts. Focus on understanding change, rates, and accumulation rather than complex formulas. Show your reasoning for each answer.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Rate of Change (Easy)

A car's position (in meters) at different times is given:
- At t = 0 seconds: position = 0 meters
- At t = 2 seconds: position = 10 meters
- At t = 4 seconds: position = 20 meters

Calculate:
- a) The rate of change (velocity) between t = 0 and t = 2
- b) The rate of change (velocity) between t = 2 and t = 4
- c) Is the velocity constant? Explain.

**Expected Output**: Two velocity values and a brief explanation for part (c).

### Task 2: Basic Accumulation (Easy)

A water tank is being filled at a constant rate of 3 liters per minute.

Calculate:
- a) How much water accumulates in 5 minutes?
- b) How much water accumulates in 10 minutes?
- c) If the tank already has 10 liters, how much total water is there after 5 more minutes?

**Expected Output**: Three numeric answers with units (liters).

### Task 3: Medium Reasoning Question

An AI model's training error decreases over epochs:
- Epoch 1: Error = 50
- Epoch 2: Error = 45
- Epoch 3: Error = 40
- Epoch 4: Error = 36

Answer:
- a) What is the rate of change of error between epochs 1 and 2?
- b) What is the rate of change of error between epochs 3 and 4?
- c) Is the model improving at a constant rate? Explain what this means for training.

**Expected Output**: Two rate values and a written explanation for part (c).

### Task 4: Medium Reasoning Question

A company's AI system processes data. The processing speed (items per second) changes:
- First 10 seconds: 5 items/second
- Next 10 seconds: 8 items/second
- Next 10 seconds: 6 items/second

Calculate:
- a) How many items are processed in the first 10 seconds?
- b) How many items are processed in the second 10 seconds?
- c) Total items processed in all 30 seconds?

**Expected Output**: Three numeric answers with brief explanations.

### Task 5: Application to AI (Medium)

A neural network's loss function value changes during training:
- Step 0: Loss = 1.0
- Step 1: Loss = 0.9
- Step 2: Loss = 0.81
- Step 3: Loss = 0.73

Answer:
- a) Calculate the rate of change (approximate derivative) for each step
- b) Is the loss decreasing at a constant rate? What does this pattern suggest?
- c) If this pattern continues, predict the loss at step 4 (show your reasoning)

**Expected Output**: 
- Table or list showing rates of change
- Written explanation for parts (b) and (c)

---

### Task 6: Understanding Direction (Medium)

Imagine you're optimizing an AI model and you calculate the gradient (derivative) at a point:
- a) If the gradient is positive, what does this tell you about the direction to move?
- b) If the gradient is negative, what does this tell you?
- c) If the gradient is zero, what does this mean?

**Expected Output**: Written explanations for all three scenarios.

---

### Task 7: Optional Python Task

Write a simple Python function that calculates the average rate of change between two points:
```python
def rate_of_change(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Calculate and return rate of change
```

Test it with:
- Point 1: (0, 0), Point 2: (2, 6)
- Point 1: (1, 5), Point 2: (3, 11)
- Point 1: (0, 10), Point 2: (5, 0)

**Expected Output**: Python code with function and three test cases showing outputs.

## Expected Output / Answer Format

For each task, provide:
- **Numeric answers**: Include units where appropriate (meters, seconds, liters, etc.)
- **Calculations**: Show your work step-by-step
- **Explanations**: Brief reasoning for medium-level questions
- **Tables**: Use tables when organizing multiple calculations

**Note**: No solutions are provided—work through each problem independently!
