# Day 7 — Student Task: Change of Basis

## Instructions

Work with basis vectors and understand coordinate transformations. Focus on conceptual understanding.

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Basis Identification (Easy)

Determine if these sets form a basis for 2D:
- a) {[1, 0], [0, 1]}
- b) {[1, 1], [1, -1]}
- c) {[1, 0], [2, 0]}
- d) {[1, 2], [2, 4]}

**Expected Output**: Four determinations with brief explanations.

---

### Task 2: Medium Reasoning Question

- a) What does it mean for vectors to form a basis?
- b) Why is the standard basis {[1,0], [0,1]} convenient?
- c) Why might we want to use a different basis in machine learning?

**Expected Output**: Written explanations for all three parts.

---

### Task 3: Application to AI (Medium)

In Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

- a) What is a principal component?
- b) Why do we want principal components to be orthogonal (perpendicular)?
- c) How does changing to a PCA basis help with dimensionality reduction?
- d) What information might we lose when reducing dimensions?

**Expected Output**: Written explanations for all four parts.

---

### Task 4: Optional Python Task

Research and write a brief explanation of how PCA performs change of basis. You may use numpy or sklearn for reference.

**Expected Output**: Written explanation with code examples if helpful.

---

## Expected Output / Answer Format

For each task, provide:
- **Determinations**: Whether sets form bases
- **Written explanations**: Clear reasoning about basis concepts
- **AI connections**: How change of basis applies to ML
- **Code**: Examples if helpful for understanding

**Note**: Focus on understanding concepts rather than complex calculations!
