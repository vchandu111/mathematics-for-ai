# Day 6 — Student Task: Matrix Patterns

## Instructions

Identify and work with special matrix patterns. Show your reasoning for each pattern type.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Identify Patterns (Easy)

Classify each matrix:
- a) [1, 0; 0, 1]
- b) [2, 0; 0, 3]
- c) [1, 2; 2, 3]
- d) [1, 0, 0; 0, 2, 0; 0, 0, 3]

**Expected Output**: Classification of each matrix (identity, diagonal, symmetric, etc.).

---

### Task 2: Identity Matrix (Easy)

- a) Multiply I = [1, 0; 0, 1] by A = [3, 4; 5, 6]
- b) Multiply A by I
- c) What do you observe?

**Expected Output**: Two matrix products and observation.

---

### Task 3: Diagonal Matrix (Easy)

For D = [2, 0; 0, 3]:
- a) Multiply D × [1; 1]
- b) Multiply D × [4; 5]
- c) What pattern do you notice?

**Expected Output**: Two products and written observation.

---

### Task 4: Medium Reasoning Question

For matrix A = [1, 2; 2, 3]:
- a) Calculate Aᵀ (transpose)
- b) Is A symmetric? Why or why not?
- c) What properties do symmetric matrices have that are useful in AI?

**Expected Output**: 
- Transpose matrix
- Symmetry determination
- Written explanation

---

### Task 5: Application to AI (Medium)

In neural networks, we sometimes use diagonal weight matrices for efficiency.

- a) Why might a diagonal matrix be more efficient than a full matrix?
- b) What limitation does a diagonal matrix have compared to a full matrix?
- c) Give an example of when diagonal matrices are used in AI.

**Expected Output**: Written explanations for all three parts.

---

### Task 6: Optional Python Task

Write Python code to:
- Check if a matrix is identity
- Check if a matrix is diagonal
- Check if a matrix is symmetric

Test with examples from Task 1.

**Expected Output**: Python code with functions and test cases.

## Expected Output / Answer Format

For each task, provide:
- **Classifications**: Identify matrix types
- **Calculations**: Show matrix operations
- **Observations**: Written patterns and properties
- **Explanations**: Brief reasoning for AI connections

**Note**: No solutions are provided—work through each problem independently!
