## Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Cross Products (Easy)

Calculate:
- a) [1, 0, 0] × [0, 1, 0]
- b) [0, 1, 0] × [0, 0, 1]
- c) [1, 2, 3] × [4, 5, 6]
- d) [1, 0, 0] × [1, 0, 0]

**Expected Output**: Four cross product vectors with work shown.

### Task 2: Perpendicular Vectors (Easy)

Find a vector perpendicular to both:
- a) [1, 0, 0] and [0, 1, 0]
- b) [1, 1, 0] and [0, 1, 1]
- c) [2, 3, 1] and [1, 2, 3]

**Expected Output**: Three perpendicular vectors.

### Task 3: Medium Reasoning Question

For u = [1, 2, 3] and v = [4, 5, 6]:

- a) Calculate u × v
- b) Calculate v × u
- c) How are they related?
- d) What property does this demonstrate?

**Expected Output**: 
- Two cross products
- Comparison
- Written property explanation

### Task 4: Optional Python Task

Write Python code to calculate cross products:

```python
import numpy as np

def cross_product(u, v):
    # Calculate cross product
    return result
```

Test with examples from Task 1.

**Expected Output**: Python code with function and test cases.
