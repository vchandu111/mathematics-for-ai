# Day 2 — Student Task: Derivative Rules

## Instructions

Use the derivative rules (power rule, constant rule, constant multiple, sum/difference) to calculate derivatives. Show your work by identifying which rule you're using for each step.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Power Rule (Easy)

Calculate the derivatives:
- a) f(x) = x⁵
- b) f(x) = x¹⁰
- c) f(x) = x (remember: x = x¹)
- d) f(x) = 1/x² (hint: rewrite as x⁻²)

**Expected Output**: Four derivative expressions with brief explanations of which rule you used.

---

### Task 2: Constant Multiple Rule (Easy)

Calculate the derivatives:
- a) f(x) = 7x³
- b) f(x) = -3x²
- c) f(x) = (1/2)x⁴
- d) f(x) = 5x

**Expected Output**: Four derivative expressions showing both the power rule and constant multiple rule.

---

### Task 3: Sum and Difference Rules (Easy)

Calculate the derivatives:
- a) f(x) = x² + x
- b) f(x) = x³ - x²
- c) f(x) = 2x² + 3x + 1
- d) f(x) = 5x³ - 2x + 7

**Expected Output**: Four derivative expressions showing how you applied the sum/difference rule term by term.

### Task 4: Medium Reasoning Question

For the function f(x) = 3x² - 6x + 2:
- a) Calculate f'(x)
- b) Calculate f'(0), f'(1), and f'(2)
- c) At which x value is f'(x) = 0? What does this mean?
- d) Is this a minimum or maximum point? How can you tell from the derivative?

**Expected Output**: 
- Derivative expression
- Three numeric values
- Answer to part (c) with explanation
- Answer to part (d) with reasoning

### Task 5: Application to AI (Medium)

A neural network's loss function is L(w) = w² - 4w + 4, where w is a weight.

- a) Calculate L'(w)
- b) Find the value of w where L'(w) = 0
- c) What does this w value represent in terms of the AI model?
- d) If the current weight is w = 1, should we increase or decrease it to minimize loss? Use the derivative to explain.

**Expected Output**: 
- Derivative expression
- Optimal w value
- Written explanations for parts (c) and (d)

### Task 6: Medium Reasoning Question

Consider f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 3x - 1.

- a) Calculate f'(x)
- b) Factor f'(x) completely
- c) Find all x values where f'(x) = 0
- d) What do these points represent on the graph of f(x)?

**Expected Output**: 
- Derivative expression
- Factored form
- X values where derivative is zero
- Brief explanation of what these points mean

---

### Task 7: Combining All Rules (Medium)

Calculate the derivatives of:
- a) f(x) = 4x⁴ - 3x³ + 2x² - x + 5
- b) g(x) = -2x⁵ + 7x³ - x
- c) h(x) = (1/3)x⁶ - (1/2)x⁴ + 2x²

**Expected Output**: Three derivative expressions with work shown.

---

### Task 8: Optional Python Task

Write a Python function that can calculate derivatives of polynomial functions using the rules:

```python
def derivative(coefficients):
    # coefficients: list like [a, b, c, d] for ax³ + bx² + cx + d
    # Return list of derivative coefficients
```

Test with:
- f(x) = 3x² + 2x + 1 → should return [6, 2] (for 6x + 2)
- f(x) = x³ - 2x² + 5x - 3 → should return [3, -4, 5] (for 3x² - 4x + 5)

**Expected Output**: Python code with function and test cases showing outputs.
